Welcome to the HR Analytics Project repository for Silver Valley Technologies! In this project, we analyzed the attendance data from the last 3 months to provide insights for the HR Generalist. By using data extraction, transformation, and loading techniques, we generated valuable insights using Power BI Desktop.

**Problem Statement**

The HR Generalist at Silver Valley Technologies needed insights from the attendance data collected over the past 3 months. The goal was to understand employee attendance patterns, develop retention strategies, and identify reasons behind sick leave percentages. The analysis also aimed to differentiate between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) percentages.

**Data Source**

The attendance data was provided as an Excel file. This data underwent Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations to prepare it for analysis.

**Steps Followed**

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Defined the scope of the analysis, focusing on attendance patterns, retention strategies, and sick leave percentages.
2. **Data Gathering and Transformation**:
   - Collected the attendance data from the provided Excel file.
   - Applied ETL operations to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3. **Creating Metrics using DAX**:
   - Implemented Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key metrics, such as attendance percentages, sick leave percentages, and WFH percentages.
4. **Dashboarding with Power BI Desktop**:
   - Used Power BI Desktop to visualize the data and create interactive dashboards.
   - Developed visualizations to provide insights into attendance trends, reasons for sick leave, and the balance between WFH and WFO percentages.
